Install 'syslog-ng-openrc' and enable/start the service.

'logrotate'

Unlike systemd logs, which are binary files, OpenRC logs are simple text files, and as such, parsable via any linux command like less, grep, awk and so on.

Log files: '/var/log/{auth,daemon,errors,everything,kernel,messages,syslog,rc,user}.log'

Some applications, like cronie or syslog-ng will create a log file in this same directory, namely, '/var/log/{crond,syslog}.log' respectively.
